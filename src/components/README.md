# Components Directory

This directory contains all React components organized by feature/domain.

## Structure:

### Common Components (`/common`)
- Shared/reusable components across the application
- Examples: Header, Footer, Navigation, Loading, Modal, Button, etc.

### Feature-specific Components:
- `/employee` - Employee related components (list, form, card, etc.)
- `/department` - Department management components
- `/project` - Project management components  
- `/timesheet` - Timesheet components (list, form, summary)
- `/timesheetEntry` - Individual timesheet entry components
- `/approval` - Approval workflow components
- `/user` - User management components
- `/role` - Role management components
- `/client` - Client management components

## Naming Convention:
- Use PascalCase for component files: `EmployeeList.js`, `TimesheetForm.js`
- Include corresponding CSS files: `EmployeeList.css`
- Use descriptive names that indicate the component's purpose
